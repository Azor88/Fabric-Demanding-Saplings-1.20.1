# Fabric-Demanding-Saplings-1.20.1
Demanding Saplings is a mod for Fabric and Quilt that changes how saplings are supposed to grow by limiting them to specific biomes and temperatures ranges.

If a sapling is placed on a wrong biome or temperature, it will perish into 1 of 3 different dead bushes, if the temperature is way too high for the sapling, it will become into a vanilla dead bush,
if the temperature is slightly off, it will become into a dead sapling, and if the temperature is way too cold, it will become a frozen bush.

This mod also adds a thermometer that lets you check for the temperature in a given biome so you know if it is compatible with the tree you want to grow, if you right click a sapling with it, it will tell you the temperature range
and optimal biome for the plant.

This mod was originally intended for the Create: Steam n' Rails community server season 2 but I decided to also publish it for everybody as it is an interesting challenge for everybody who wants to expand their wood collection.
